DESCRIPTION
    Turtle graphics - популярный путь к представлению программирования для детей. 
	Это была часть оригинального развитого языка программирования Logo Уолли Феерзиг
	и Сеймур Пэперт в 1966.
    
    Рисование в robotic turtle начинается в (0, 0) в x-y осях. После ''импортируют 
	черепаху'', дают его команда turtle.forward(15), и это перемещается (на экране!)
	15 пикселей в направление, с которым это стоит, чертя линию, поскольку это пере-
	мещается. Дайте его командуйте turtle.right(25), и он вращает оперативные 25 гра-
	дусов по часовой стрелке.
    
    Объединяя вместе эти и подобные команды, запутанные формы и картины могут легко 
	быть нарисованы.
    
    ----- turtle.py
    
    Этот модуль - расширенное переопределение turtle.py для стандарта Python начиная
	с Python 2.5. (Смотрите: http://www.python.org)
    
    Достоинства turtle.py в его совместимости (почти) 100%. Это означает во-первых 
	включать учащийся программист для использования всех команд, классов и методов
    в интерактивном режиме при использовании модуля из IDLE выполнения с  переключа-
	тель-n.
    
    Примерно этому добавили следующие функции:
    
    - Лучшая анимация перемещений turtle, особенно превращения turtle. Таким обра-
	  зом, turtle могут более легко использоваться в качестве визуальной обратной
	  связи инструмент (начинающим) программистом.
    
    - Различные формы turtle, gif-изображения, поскольку turtle формирует, определя-
	  емый пользователем и пользователь управляемые формы turtle, среди них состав-
	  ной объект (разноцветные) формы. Формы turtle могут быть расширены и наклоне-
	  ны, который делает turtle очень универсальными геометрическими объектами.
    
    - Точная регулировка по перемещению черепахи и экрану обновляет через методы
	  delay() <задержка> и улучшеный tracer() <трисировщик> и speed() <скорость>.
    
    - Псевдонимы для обычно используемых команд, как fd для вперед и т.д., следова-
	  ние ранним традициям Logo. Это уменьшает растачивание ввод длинных последова-
	  тельностей команд, которые часто происходят естественным способом когда дети
	  пытаются программировать необычные картины на своем первом обнаружении с гра-
	  фика с относительными командами.
    
    - Turtles теперь есть undo() <отмена> - метод с настраиваемым буфером отмены.
    
    - Некоторые простые команды/методы для создания управляемых событиями программ
      (мышь - ключ - события таймера). Особенно полезный для программирования игр.
    
    - класс с возможностью прокрутки - Canvas. Canvas может быть с возможностью 
	  прокрутки по умолчанию также расширенный в интерактивном режиме по мере необ-
	  ходимости при игре вокруг с turtle(s).
    
    - TurtleScreen класс с методами, управляющими цветом фона или фоновое изображе-
	  ние, окно и размер холста и другие свойства TurtleScreen.
    
    - Существует метод, setworldcoordinates(), для установки определяемого пользова-
	  телем система координат для TurtleScreen.
    
    - Реализация использует класс с 2 векторами по имени Vec2D, полученный из корте-
	  жа. Этот класс общедоступен, таким образом, он может быть импортирован при-
	  кладным программистом, который делает определенные типы из вычислений очень 
	  естественными и компактными.
    
    - Появление TurtleScreen и Turtle при запуске/импорте может быть настроенный по-
	  средством turtle.cfg конфигурационного файла. Конфигурация по умолчанию подра-
	  жает появлению старого модуля черепахи.
    
    - Если настроено соответственно модуль читает в docstrings из docstring словарь 
	  на некотором различном языке, предоставленном отдельно и замены английские 
	  считанными в. Существует служебная функция write_docstringdict() для записи 
	  словаря с оригиналом (английский язык) docstrings к диску, таким образом, это
	  может служить шаблоном для переводов.
    
    Негласно существуют некоторые функции, включенные с возможным расширения в памя-
	ти. Они будут прокомментированы и зарегистрированы в другом месте.

     |      
     |      Example (for a Turtle instance named turtle):
     |      >>> turtle.end_poly()
     |

     |      False else)
     |      
     |      Example (for a Turtle instance named turtle):
     |      >>> turtle.fill(True)

     |  
     |  get_poly(self)
     |      Return the lastly recorded polygon.
     |      
     |      No argument.
     |      
     |      Example (for a Turtle instance named turtle):
     |      >>> p = turtle.get_poly()
     |      >>> turtle.register_shape("myFavouriteShape", p)
     |  
     |  getpen = getturtle(self)

     |      
     |      No argument.
     |      
     |      Only reasonable use: as a function to return the 'anonymous turtle':
     |      
     |      Example:
     |      >>> pet = getturtle()
     |      >>> pet.fd(50)
     |      >>> pet
     |      <turtle.Turtle object at 0x0187D810>
     |      >>> turtles()
     |      [<turtle.Turtle object at 0x0187D810>]
     |  
     |  getscreen(self)
     |      Return the TurtleScreen object, the turtle is drawing  on.
     |      
     |      No argument.
     |      
     |      Return the TurtleScreen object, the turtle is drawing  on.
     |      So TurtleScreen-methods can be called for that object.
     |      
     |      Example (for a Turtle instance named turtle):
     |      >>> ts = turtle.getscreen()
     |      >>> ts
     |      <turtle.TurtleScreen object at 0x0106B770>
     |      >>> ts.bgcolor("pink")
     |  
     |  getturtle(self)
     |      Return the Turtleobject itself.
     |      
     |      No argument.
     |      
     |      Only reasonable use: as a function to return the 'anonymous turtle':
     |      
     |      Example:
     |      >>> pet = getturtle()
     |      >>> pet.fd(50)
     |      >>> pet
     |      <turtle.Turtle object at 0x0187D810>
     |      >>> turtles()
     |      [<turtle.Turtle object at 0x0187D810>]
     |  
     |  onclick(self, fun, btn=1, add=None)
     |      Bind fun to mouse-click event on this turtle on canvas.
     |      
     |      Arguments:
     |      fun --  a function with two arguments, to which will be assigned
     |              the coordinates of the clicked point on the canvas.
     |      num --  number of the mouse-button defaults to 1 (left mouse button).
     |      add --  True or False. If True, new binding will be added, otherwise
     |              it will replace a former binding.
     |      
     |      Example for the anonymous turtle, i. e. the procedural way:
     |      
     |      >>> def turn(x, y):
     |      ...     left(360)
     |      ...
     |      >>> onclick(turn)  # Now clicking into the turtle will turn it.
     |      >>> onclick(None)  # event-binding will be removed
     |  
     |  ondrag(self, fun, btn=1, add=None)
     |      Bind fun to mouse-move event on this turtle on canvas.
     |      
     |      Arguments:
     |      fun -- a function with two arguments, to which will be assigned
     |             the coordinates of the clicked point on the canvas.
     |      num -- number of the mouse-button defaults to 1 (left mouse button).
     |      
     |      Every sequence of mouse-move-events on a turtle is preceded by a
     |      mouse-click event on that turtle.
     |      
     |      Example (for a Turtle instance named turtle):
     |      >>> turtle.ondrag(turtle.goto)
     |      
     |      Subsequently clicking and dragging a Turtle will move it
     |      across the screen thereby producing handdrawings (if pen is
     |      down).
     |  
     |  onrelease(self, fun, btn=1, add=None)
     |      Bind fun to mouse-button-release event on this turtle on canvas.
     |      
     |      Arguments:
     |      fun -- a function with two arguments, to which will be assigned
     |              the coordinates of the clicked point on the canvas.
     |      num --  number of the mouse-button defaults to 1 (left mouse button).
     |      
     |      Example (for a MyTurtle instance named joe):
     |      >>> class MyTurtle(Turtle):
     |      ...     def glow(self,x,y):
     |      ...             self.fillcolor("red")
     |      ...     def unglow(self,x,y):
     |      ...             self.fillcolor("")
     |      ...
     |      >>> joe = MyTurtle()
     |      >>> joe.onclick(joe.glow)
     |      >>> joe.onrelease(joe.unglow)
     |      
     |      Clicking on joe turns fillcolor red, unclicking turns it to
     |      transparent.
     |  
     |  reset(self)
     |      Delete the turtle's drawings and restore its default values.
     |      
     |              No argument.
     |      ,
     |              Delete the turtle's drawings from the screen, re-center the turtle
     |              and set variables to the default values.
     |      
     |              Example (for a Turtle instance named turtle):
     |              >>> turtle.position()
     |              (0.00,-22.00)
     |              >>> turtle.heading()
     |              100.0
     |              >>> turtle.reset()
     |              >>> turtle.position()
     |              (0.00,0.00)
     |              >>> turtle.heading()
     |              0.0
     |  
     |  settiltangle(self, angle)
     |      Rotate the turtleshape to point in the specified direction
     |      
     |      Optional argument:
     |      angle -- number
     |      
     |      Rotate the turtleshape to point in the direction specified by angle,
     |      regardless of its current tilt-angle. DO NOT change the turtle's
     |      heading (direction of movement).
     |      
     |      
     |      Examples (for a Turtle instance named turtle):
     |      >>> turtle.shape("circle")
     |      >>> turtle.shapesize(5,2)
     |      >>> turtle.settiltangle(45)
     |      >>> stamp()
     |      >>> turtle.fd(50)
     |      >>> turtle.settiltangle(-45)
     |      >>> stamp()
     |      >>> turtle.fd(50)
     |  
     |  setundobuffer(self, size)
     |      Set or disable undobuffer.
     |      
     |      Argument:
     |      size -- an integer or None
     |      
     |      If size is an integer an empty undobuffer of given size is installed.
     |      Size gives the maximum number of turtle-actions that can be undone
     |      by the undo() function.
     |      If size is None, no undobuffer is present.
     |      
     |      Example (for a Turtle instance named turtle):
     |      >>> turtle.setundobuffer(42)
     |  
     |  shape(self, name=None)
     |      Set turtle shape to shape with given name / return current shapename.
     |      
     |      Optional argument:
     |      name -- a string, which is a valid shapename
     |      
     |      Set turtle shape to shape with given name or, if name is not given,
     |      return name of current shape.
     |      Shape with name must exist in the TurtleScreen's shape dictionary.
     |      Initially there are the following polygon shapes:
     |      'arrow', 'turtle', 'circle', 'square', 'triangle', 'classic'.
     |      To learn about how to deal with shapes see Screen-method register_shape.
     |      
     |      Example (for a Turtle instance named turtle):
     |      >>> turtle.shape()
     |      'arrow'
     |      >>> turtle.shape("turtle")
     |      >>> turtle.shape()
     |      'turtle'
     |  
     |  shapesize(self, stretch_wid=None, stretch_len=None, outline=None)
     |      Set/return turtle's stretchfactors/outline. Set resizemode to "user".
     |      
     |      Optional arguments:
     |         stretch_wid : positive number
     |         stretch_len : positive number
     |         outline  : positive number
     |      
     |      Return or set the pen's attributes x/y-stretchfactors and/or outline.
     |      Set resizemode to "user".
     |      If and only if resizemode is set to "user", the turtle will be displayed
     |      stretched according to its stretchfactors:
     |      stretch_wid is stretchfactor perpendicular to orientation
     |      stretch_len is stretchfactor in direction of turtles orientation.
     |      outline determines the width of the shapes's outline.
     |      
     |      Examples (for a Turtle instance named turtle):
     |      >>> turtle.resizemode("user")
     |      >>> turtle.shapesize(5, 5, 12)
     |      >>> turtle.shapesize(outline=8)
     |

     |      
     |      Stamp a copy of the turtle shape onto the canvas at the current
     |      turtle position. Return a stamp_id for that stamp, which can be
     |      used to delete it by calling clearstamp(stamp_id).
     |      
     |      Example (for a Turtle instance named turtle):
     |      >>> turtle.color("blue")
     |      >>> turtle.stamp()

     |      
     |      Rotate the turtleshape by angle from its current tilt-angle,
     |      but do NOT change the turtle's heading (direction of movement).
     |      
     |      Examples (for a Turtle instance named turtle):
     |      >>> turtle.shape("circle")
     |      >>> turtle.shapesize(5,2)

     |      
     |      Return the current tilt-angle, i. e. the angle between the
     |      orientation of the turtleshape and the heading of the turtle
     |      (its direction of movement).
     |      
     |      Examples (for a Turtle instance named turtle):

     |      
     |      No argument.
     |      
     |      undo (repeatedly) the last turtle action.
     |      Number of available undo actions is determined by the size of
     |      the undobuffer.
     |      
     |      Example (for a Turtle instance named turtle):

     |      640
     |  
     |  write(self, arg, move=False, align='left', font=('Arial', 8, 'normal'))
     |      Write text at the current turtle position.
     |      
     |      Arguments:

     |  Methods inherited from TPen:
     |  
     |  color(self, *args)
     |      Return or set the pencolor and fillcolor.
     |      
     |      Arguments:
     |      Several input formats are allowed.
     |      They use 0, 1, 2, or 3 arguments as follows:
     |      
     |      color()
     |          Return the current pencolor and the current fillcolor
     |          as a pair of color specification strings as are returned
     |          by pencolor and fillcolor.
     |      color(colorstring), color((r,g,b)), color(r,g,b)
     |          inputs as in pencolor, set both, fillcolor and pencolor,
     |          to the given value.
     |      color(colorstring1, colorstring2),
     |      color((r1,g1,b1), (r2,g2,b2))
     |          equivalent to pencolor(colorstring1) and fillcolor(colorstring2)
     |          and analogously, if the other input format is used.
     |      
     |      If turtleshape is a polygon, outline and interior of that polygon
     |      is drawn with the newly set colors.
     |      For mor info see: pencolor, fillcolor
     |      
     |      Example (for a Turtle instance named turtle):
     |      >>> turtle.color('red', 'green')
     |      >>> turtle.color()
     |      ('red', 'green')
     |      >>> colormode(255)
     |      >>> color((40, 80, 120), (160, 200, 240))
     |      >>> color()
     |      ('#285078', '#a0c8f0')
     |  
     |  down = pendown(self)
     |      Pull the pen down -- drawing when moving.
     |      
     |      Aliases: pendown | pd | down
     |      
     |      No argument.
     |      
     |      Example (for a Turtle instance named turtle):
     |      >>> turtle.pendown()
     |  
     |  fillcolor(self, *args)
     |      Return or set the fillcolor.
     |      
     |      Arguments:
     |      Four input formats are allowed:
     |        - fillcolor()
     |          Return the current fillcolor as color specification string,
     |          possibly in hex-number format (see example).
     |          May be used as input to another color/pencolor/fillcolor call.
     |        - fillcolor(colorstring)
     |          s is a Tk color specification string, such as "red" or "yellow"
     |        - fillcolor((r, g, b))
     |          *a tuple* of r, g, and b, which represent, an RGB color,
     |          and each of r, g, and b are in the range 0..colormode,
     |          where colormode is either 1.0 or 255
     |        - fillcolor(r, g, b)
     |          r, g, and b represent an RGB color, and each of r, g, and b
     |          are in the range 0..colormode
     |      
     |      If turtleshape is a polygon, the interior of that polygon is drawn
     |      with the newly set fillcolor.
     |      
     |      Example (for a Turtle instance named turtle):
     |      >>> turtle.fillcolor('violet')
     |      >>> col = turtle.pencolor()
     |      >>> turtle.fillcolor(col)
     |      >>> turtle.fillcolor(0, .5, 0)
     |  
     |  hideturtle(self)
     |      Makes the turtle invisible.
     |      
     |      Aliases: hideturtle | ht
     |      
     |      No argument.
     |      
     |      It's a good idea to do this while you're in the
     |      middle of a complicated drawing, because hiding
     |      the turtle speeds up the drawing observably.
     |      
     |      Example (for a Turtle instance named turtle):
     |      >>> turtle.hideturtle()
     |  
     |  ht = hideturtle(self)
     |      Makes the turtle invisible.

     |  pen(self, pen=None, **pendict)
     |      Return or set the pen's attributes.
     |      
     |      Arguments:
     |          pen -- a dictionary with some or all of the below listed keys.
     |          **pendict -- one or more keyword-arguments with the below
     |                       listed keys as keywords.
     |      
     |      Return or set the pen's attributes in a 'pen-dictionary'
     |      with the following key/value pairs:

     |         "tilt"       :   number
     |      
     |      This dictionary can be used as argument for a subsequent
     |      pen()-call to restore the former pen-state. Moreover one
     |      or more of these attributes can be provided as keyword-arguments.
     |      This can be used to set several pen attributes in one statement.
     |      
     |      
     |      Examples (for a Turtle instance named turtle):
     |      >>> turtle.pen(fillcolor="black", pencolor="red", pensize=10)

     |  resizemode(self, rmode=None)
     |      Set resizemode to one of the values: "auto", "user", "noresize".
     |      
     |      (Optional) Argument:
     |      rmode -- one of the strings "auto", "user", "noresize"
     |      
     |      Different resizemodes have the following effects:
     |        - "auto" adapts the appearance of the turtle
     |                 corresponding to the value of pensize.
     |        - "user" adapts the appearance of the turtle according to the
     |                 values of stretchfactor and outlinewidth (outline),
     |                 which are set by shapesize()
     |        - "noresize" no adaption of the turtle's appearance takes place.
     |      If no argument is given, return current resizemode.
     |      resizemode("user") is called by a call of shapesize with arguments.
     |

     |  speed(self, speed=None)
     |      Return or set the turtle's speed.
     |      
     |      Optional argument:
     |      speed -- an integer in the range 0..10 or a speedstring (see below)
     |      
     |      Set the turtle's speed to an integer value in the range 0 .. 10.
     |      If no argument is given: return current speed.
     |      
     |      If input is a number greater than 10 or smaller than 0.5,
     |      speed is set to 0.
     |      Speedstrings  are mapped to speedvalues in the following way:
     |          'fastest' :  0
     |          'fast'    :  10
     |          'normal'  :  6
     |          'slow'    :  3
     |          'slowest' :  1
     |      speeds from 1 to 10 enforce increasingly faster animation of
     |      line drawing and turtle turning.
     |      
     |      Attention:
     |      speed = 0 : *no* animation takes place. forward/back makes turtle jump
     |      and likewise left/right make the turtle turn instantly.

     |      
     |      Draw a circle with given radius. The center is radius units left
     |      of the turtle; extent - an angle - determines which part of the
     |      circle is drawn. If extent is not given, draw the entire circle.
     |      If extent is not a full circle, one endpoint of the arc is the
     |      current pen position. Draw the arc in counterclockwise direction

     |  
     |  onclick(self, fun, btn=1, add=None)
     |      Bind fun to mouse-click event on this turtle on canvas.
     |      
     |      Arguments:
     |      fun --  a function with two arguments, to which will be assigned
     |              the coordinates of the clicked point on the canvas.
     |      num --  number of the mouse-button defaults to 1 (left mouse button).
     |      add --  True or False. If True, new binding will be added, otherwise
     |              it will replace a former binding.
     |      
     |      Example for the anonymous turtle, i. e. the procedural way:
     |      
     |      >>> def turn(x, y):
     |      ...     left(360)
     |      ...
     |      >>> onclick(turn)  # Now clicking into the turtle will turn it.
     |      >>> onclick(None)  # event-binding will be removed
     |  
     |  ondrag(self, fun, btn=1, add=None)
     |      Bind fun to mouse-move event on this turtle on canvas.
     |      
     |      Arguments:
     |      fun -- a function with two arguments, to which will be assigned
     |             the coordinates of the clicked point on the canvas.
     |      num -- number of the mouse-button defaults to 1 (left mouse button).
     |      
     |      Every sequence of mouse-move-events on a turtle is preceded by a
     |      mouse-click event on that turtle.
     |      
     |      Example (for a Turtle instance named turtle):
     |      >>> turtle.ondrag(turtle.goto)
     |      
     |      Subsequently clicking and dragging a Turtle will move it
     |      across the screen thereby producing handdrawings (if pen is
     |      down).
     |  
     |  onrelease(self, fun, btn=1, add=None)
     |      Bind fun to mouse-button-release event on this turtle on canvas.
     |      
     |      Arguments:
     |      fun -- a function with two arguments, to which will be assigned
     |              the coordinates of the clicked point on the canvas.
     |      num --  number of the mouse-button defaults to 1 (left mouse button).
     |      
     |      Example (for a MyTurtle instance named joe):
     |      >>> class MyTurtle(Turtle):
     |      ...     def glow(self,x,y):
     |      ...             self.fillcolor("red")
     |      ...     def unglow(self,x,y):
     |      ...             self.fillcolor("")
     |      ...
     |      >>> joe = MyTurtle()
     |      >>> joe.onclick(joe.glow)
     |      >>> joe.onrelease(joe.unglow)
     |      
     |      Clicking on joe turns fillcolor red, unclicking turns it to
     |      transparent.
     |  
     |  reset(self)
     |      Delete the turtle's drawings and restore its default values.
     |      
     |              No argument.
     |      ,
     |              Delete the turtle's drawings from the screen, re-center the turtle
     |              and set variables to the default values.
     |      
     |              Example (for a Turtle instance named turtle):
     |              >>> turtle.position()
     |              (0.00,-22.00)
     |              >>> turtle.heading()
     |              100.0
     |              >>> turtle.reset()
     |              >>> turtle.position()
     |              (0.00,0.00)
     |              >>> turtle.heading()
     |              0.0
     |  
     |  settiltangle(self, angle)
     |      Rotate the turtleshape to point in the specified direction
     |      
     |      Optional argument:
     |      angle -- number
     |      
     |      Rotate the turtleshape to point in the direction specified by angle,
     |      regardless of its current tilt-angle. DO NOT change the turtle's
     |      heading (direction of movement).
     |      
     |      
     |      Examples (for a Turtle instance named turtle):
     |      >>> turtle.shape("circle")
     |      >>> turtle.shapesize(5,2)
     |      >>> turtle.settiltangle(45)
     |      >>> stamp()
     |      >>> turtle.fd(50)
     |      >>> turtle.settiltangle(-45)
     |      >>> stamp()
     |      >>> turtle.fd(50)
     |  
     |  setundobuffer(self, size)
     |      Set or disable undobuffer.
     |      
     |      Argument:
     |      size -- an integer or None
     |      
     |      If size is an integer an empty undobuffer of given size is installed.
     |      Size gives the maximum number of turtle-actions that can be undone
     |      by the undo() function.
     |      If size is None, no undobuffer is present.
     |      
     |      Example (for a Turtle instance named turtle):
     |      >>> turtle.setundobuffer(42)
     |  
     |  shape(self, name=None)
     |      Set turtle shape to shape with given name / return current shapename.
     |      
     |      Optional argument:
     |      name -- a string, which is a valid shapename
     |      
     |      Set turtle shape to shape with given name or, if name is not given,
     |      return name of current shape.
     |      Shape with name must exist in the TurtleScreen's shape dictionary.
     |      Initially there are the following polygon shapes:
     |      'arrow', 'turtle', 'circle', 'square', 'triangle', 'classic'.
     |      To learn about how to deal with shapes see Screen-method register_shape.
     |      
     |      Example (for a Turtle instance named turtle):
     |      >>> turtle.shape()
     |      'arrow'
     |      >>> turtle.shape("turtle")
     |      >>> turtle.shape()
     |      'turtle'
     |  
     |  shapesize(self, stretch_wid=None, stretch_len=None, outline=None)
     |      Set/return turtle's stretchfactors/outline. Set resizemode to "user".
     |      
     |      Optional arguments:
     |         stretch_wid : positive number
     |         stretch_len : positive number
     |         outline  : positive number
     |      
     |      Return or set the pen's attributes x/y-stretchfactors and/or outline.
     |      Set resizemode to "user".
     |      If and only if resizemode is set to "user", the turtle will be displayed
     |      stretched according to its stretchfactors:
     |      stretch_wid is stretchfactor perpendicular to orientation
     |      stretch_len is stretchfactor in direction of turtles orientation.
     |      outline determines the width of the shapes's outline.
     |      
     |      Examples (for a Turtle instance named turtle):
     |      >>> turtle.resizemode("user")
     |      >>> turtle.shapesize(5, 5, 12)
     |      >>> turtle.shapesize(outline=8)
     |  
     |  stamp(self)
     |      Stamp a copy of the turtleshape onto the canvas and return its id.
     |      
     |      No argument.
     |      
     |      Stamp a copy of the turtle shape onto the canvas at the current
     |      turtle position. Return a stamp_id for that stamp, which can be
     |      used to delete it by calling clearstamp(stamp_id).
     |      
     |      Example (for a Turtle instance named turtle):
     |      >>> turtle.color("blue")
     |      >>> turtle.stamp()
     |      13
     |      >>> turtle.fd(50)
     |  
     |  tilt(self, angle)
     |      Rotate the turtleshape by angle.
     |      
     |      Argument:
     |      angle - a number
     |      
     |      Rotate the turtleshape by angle from its current tilt-angle,
     |      but do NOT change the turtle's heading (direction of movement).
     |      
     |      Examples (for a Turtle instance named turtle):
     |      >>> turtle.shape("circle")
     |      >>> turtle.shapesize(5,2)
     |      >>> turtle.tilt(30)

     |      
     |      Return the current tilt-angle, i. e. the angle between the
     |      orientation of the turtleshape and the heading of the turtle
     |      (its direction of movement).
     |      
     |      Examples (for a Turtle instance named turtle):
     |      >>> turtle.shape("circle")
     |      >>> turtle.shapesize(5,2)
     |      >>> turtle.tilt(45)
     |      >>> turtle.tiltangle()
     |  
     |  tracer(self, flag=None, delay=None)
     |      Turns turtle animation on/off and set delay for update drawings.
     |      
     |      Optional arguments:
     |      n -- nonnegative  integer
     |      delay -- nonnegative  integer
     |      
     |      If n is given, only each n-th regular screen update is really performed.
     |      (Can be used to accelerate the drawing of complex graphics.)
     |      Second arguments sets delay value (see RawTurtle.delay())
     |      
     |      Example (for a Turtle instance named turtle):
     |      >>> turtle.tracer(8, 25)
     |      >>> dist = 2
     |      >>> for i in range(200):
     |      ...     turtle.fd(dist)
     |      ...     turtle.rt(90)
     |      ...     dist += 2
     |  
     |  turtlesize = shapesize(self, stretch_wid=None, stretch_len=None, outline=None)
     |  
     |  undo(self)
     |      undo (repeatedly) the last turtle action.
     |      
     |      No argument.
     |      
     |      undo (repeatedly) the last turtle action.
     |      Number of available undo actions is determined by the size of
     |      the undobuffer.
     |      
     |      Example (for a Turtle instance named turtle):
     |      >>> for i in range(4):

     |      640
     |  
     |  write(self, arg, move=False, align='left', font=('Arial', 8, 'normal'))
     |      Write text at the current turtle position.
     |      
     |      Arguments:

     |  Methods inherited from TPen:
     |  
     |  color(self, *args)
     |      Return or set the pencolor and fillcolor.
     |      
     |      Arguments:
     |      Several input formats are allowed.
     |      They use 0, 1, 2, or 3 arguments as follows:
     |      
     |      color()
     |          Return the current pencolor and the current fillcolor
     |          as a pair of color specification strings as are returned
     |          by pencolor and fillcolor.
     |      color(colorstring), color((r,g,b)), color(r,g,b)
     |          inputs as in pencolor, set both, fillcolor and pencolor,
     |          to the given value.
     |      color(colorstring1, colorstring2),
     |      color((r1,g1,b1), (r2,g2,b2))
     |          equivalent to pencolor(colorstring1) and fillcolor(colorstring2)
     |          and analogously, if the other input format is used.
     |      
     |      If turtleshape is a polygon, outline and interior of that polygon
     |      is drawn with the newly set colors.
     |      For mor info see: pencolor, fillcolor
     |      
     |      Example (for a Turtle instance named turtle):

     |      >>> color()
     |      ('#285078', '#a0c8f0')
     |  
     |  down = pendown(self)
     |      Pull the pen down -- drawing when moving.
     |      
     |      Aliases: pendown | pd | down
     |      
     |      No argument.
     |      
     |      Example (for a Turtle instance named turtle):
     |      >>> turtle.pendown()
     |  
     |  fillcolor(self, *args)
     |      Return or set the fillcolor.
     |      
     |      Arguments:
     |      Four input formats are allowed:
     |        - fillcolor()
     |          Return the current fillcolor as color specification string,
     |          possibly in hex-number format (see example).
     |          May be used as input to another color/pencolor/fillcolor call.
     |        - fillcolor(colorstring)
     |          s is a Tk color specification string, such as "red" or "yellow"
     |        - fillcolor((r, g, b))
     |          *a tuple* of r, g, and b, which represent, an RGB color,
     |          and each of r, g, and b are in the range 0..colormode,
     |          where colormode is either 1.0 or 255
     |        - fillcolor(r, g, b)
     |          r, g, and b represent an RGB color, and each of r, g, and b
     |          are in the range 0..colormode
     |      
     |      If turtleshape is a polygon, the interior of that polygon is drawn
     |      with the newly set fillcolor.
     |      
     |      Example (for a Turtle instance named turtle):
     |      >>> turtle.fillcolor('violet')
     |      >>> col = turtle.pencolor()
     |      >>> turtle.fillcolor(col)
     |      >>> turtle.fillcolor(0, .5, 0)

     |      
     |      Aliases: hideturtle | ht
     |      
     |      No argument.
     |      
     |      It's a good idea to do this while you're in the
     |      middle of a complicated drawing, because hiding
     |      the turtle speeds up the drawing observably.
     |      
     |      Example (for a Turtle instance named turtle):
     |      >>> turtle.hideturtle()
     |  
     |  ht = hideturtle(self)

     |  pen(self, pen=None, **pendict)
     |      Return or set the pen's attributes.
     |      
     |      Arguments:
     |          pen -- a dictionary with some or all of the below listed keys.
     |          **pendict -- one or more keyword-arguments with the below
     |                       listed keys as keywords.
     |      
     |      Return or set the pen's attributes in a 'pen-dictionary'
     |      with the following key/value pairs:

     |         "tilt"       :   number
     |      
     |      This dictionary can be used as argument for a subsequent
     |      pen()-call to restore the former pen-state. Moreover one
     |      or more of these attributes can be provided as keyword-arguments.
     |      This can be used to set several pen attributes in one statement.
     |      
     |      
     |      Examples (for a Turtle instance named turtle):

     |  pencolor(self, *args)
     |      Return or set the pencolor.
     |      
     |      Arguments:
     |      Four input formats are allowed:
     |        - pencolor()
     |          Return the current pencolor as color specification string,
     |          possibly in hex-number format (see example).
     |          May be used as input to another color/pencolor/fillcolor call.
     |        - pencolor(colorstring)
     |          s is a Tk color specification string, such as "red" or "yellow"
     |        - pencolor((r, g, b))
     |          *a tuple* of r, g, and b, which represent, an RGB color,
     |          and each of r, g, and b are in the range 0..colormode,
     |          where colormode is either 1.0 or 255
     |        - pencolor(r, g, b)
     |          r, g, and b represent an RGB color, and each of r, g, and b
     |          are in the range 0..colormode
     |      
     |      If turtleshape is a polygon, the outline of that polygon is drawn
     |      with the newly set pencolor.
     |      
     |      Example (for a Turtle instance named turtle):
     |      >>> turtle.pencolor('brown')
     |      >>> tup = (0.2, 0.8, 0.55)
     |      >>> turtle.pencolor(tup)

     |      '#33cc8c'
     |  
     |  pendown(self)
     |      Pull the pen down -- drawing when moving.

     |      Example (for a Turtle instance named turtle):
     |      >>> turtle.pendown()
     |  
     |  pensize(self, width=None)
     |      Set or return the line thickness.
     |      
     |      Aliases:  pensize | width
     |      
     |      Argument:
     |      width -- positive number
     |      
     |      Set the line thickness to width or return it. If resizemode is set
     |      to "auto" and turtleshape is a polygon, that polygon is drawn with
     |      the same line thickness. If no argument is given, current pensize
     |      is returned.
     |      
     |      Example (for a Turtle instance named turtle):
     |      >>> turtle.pensize()
     |      1
     |      >>> turtle.pensize(10)   # from here on lines of width 10 are drawn
     |

     |  resizemode(self, rmode=None)
     |      Set resizemode to one of the values: "auto", "user", "noresize".
     |      
     |      (Optional) Argument:
     |      rmode -- one of the strings "auto", "user", "noresize"
     |      
     |      Different resizemodes have the following effects:
     |        - "auto" adapts the appearance of the turtle
     |                 corresponding to the value of pensize.
     |        - "user" adapts the appearance of the turtle according to the
     |                 values of stretchfactor and outlinewidth (outline),
     |                 which are set by shapesize()
     |        - "noresize" no adaption of the turtle's appearance takes place.
     |      If no argument is given, return current resizemode.
     |      resizemode("user") is called by a call of shapesize with arguments.
     |      
     |      
     |      Examples (for a Turtle instance named turtle):
     |      >>> turtle.resizemode("noresize")
     |      >>> turtle.resizemode()
     |      'noresize'
     |

     |  speed(self, speed=None)
     |      Return or set the turtle's speed.
     |      
     |      Optional argument:
     |      speed -- an integer in the range 0..10 or a speedstring (see below)
     |      
     |      Set the turtle's speed to an integer value in the range 0 .. 10.
     |      If no argument is given: return current speed.
     |      
     |      If input is a number greater than 10 or smaller than 0.5,
     |      speed is set to 0.
     |      Speedstrings  are mapped to speedvalues in the following way:
     |          'fastest' :  0
     |          'fast'    :  10
     |          'normal'  :  6
     |          'slow'    :  3
     |          'slowest' :  1
     |      speeds from 1 to 10 enforce increasingly faster animation of
     |      line drawing and turtle turning.
     |      
     |      Attention:
     |      speed = 0 : *no* animation takes place. forward/back makes turtle jump
     |      and likewise left/right make the turtle turn instantly.
     |

     |      
     |      Draw a circle with given radius. The center is radius units left
     |      of the turtle; extent - an angle - determines which part of the
     |      circle is drawn. If extent is not given, draw the entire circle.
     |      If extent is not a full circle, one endpoint of the arc is the
     |      current pen position. Draw the arc in counterclockwise direction

     |      As the circle is approximated by an inscribed regular polygon,
     |      steps determines the number of steps to use. If not given,
     |      it will be calculated automatically. Maybe used to draw regular

     |      last point of polygon. This will be connected with the first point.
     |      
     |      Example (for a Turtle instance named turtle):
     |      >>> turtle.end_poly()
     |  
     |  fill(self, flag=None)
     |      Call fill(True) before drawing a shape to fill, fill(False) when done.
     |      
     |      Optional argument:
     |      flag -- True/False (or 1/0 respectively)
     |      
     |      Call fill(True) before drawing the shape you want to fill,
     |      and  fill(False) when done.
     |      When used without argument: return fillstate (True if filling,
     |      False else)
     |      
     |      Example (for a Turtle instance named turtle):
     |      >>> turtle.fill(True)
     |      >>> turtle.forward(100)
     |      >>> turtle.left(90)
     |      >>> turtle.forward(100)
     |      >>> turtle.left(90)
     |      >>> turtle.forward(100)
     |      >>> turtle.left(90)
     |      >>> turtle.forward(100)
     |      >>> turtle.fill(False)
     |  
     |  get_poly(self)
     |      Return the lastly recorded polygon.
     |      
     |      No argument.
     |      
     |      Example (for a Turtle instance named turtle):
     |      >>> p = turtle.get_poly()
     |      >>> turtle.register_shape("myFavouriteShape", p)
     |  
     |  getpen = getturtle(self)
     |  
     |  getscreen(self)
     |      Return the TurtleScreen object, the turtle is drawing  on.
     |      
     |      No argument.
     |      
     |      Return the TurtleScreen object, the turtle is drawing  on.
     |      So TurtleScreen-methods can be called for that object.
     |      
     |      Example (for a Turtle instance named turtle):
     |      >>> ts = turtle.getscreen()
     |      >>> ts
     |      <turtle.TurtleScreen object at 0x0106B770>
     |      >>> ts.bgcolor("pink")
     |  
     |  getturtle(self)
     |      Return the Turtleobject itself.
     |      
     |      No argument.
     |      
     |      Only reasonable use: as a function to return the 'anonymous turtle':
     |      
     |      Example:
     |      >>> pet = getturtle()
     |      >>> pet.fd(50)
     |      >>> pet
     |      <turtle.Turtle object at 0x0187D810>
     |      >>> turtles()
     |      [<turtle.Turtle object at 0x0187D810>]
     |  
     |  onclick(self, fun, btn=1, add=None)
     |      Bind fun to mouse-click event on this turtle on canvas.
     |      
     |      Arguments:
     |      fun --  a function with two arguments, to which will be assigned
     |              the coordinates of the clicked point on the canvas.
     |      num --  number of the mouse-button defaults to 1 (left mouse button).
     |      add --  True or False. If True, new binding will be added, otherwise
     |              it will replace a former binding.
     |      
     |      Example for the anonymous turtle, i. e. the procedural way:
     |      
     |      >>> def turn(x, y):
     |      ...     left(360)
     |      ...
     |      >>> onclick(turn)  # Now clicking into the turtle will turn it.
     |      >>> onclick(None)  # event-binding will be removed
     |  
     |  ondrag(self, fun, btn=1, add=None)
     |      Bind fun to mouse-move event on this turtle on canvas.
     |      
     |      Arguments:
     |      fun -- a function with two arguments, to which will be assigned
     |             the coordinates of the clicked point on the canvas.
     |      num -- number of the mouse-button defaults to 1 (left mouse button).
     |      
     |      Every sequence of mouse-move-events on a turtle is preceded by a
     |      mouse-click event on that turtle.
     |      
     |      Example (for a Turtle instance named turtle):
     |      >>> turtle.ondrag(turtle.goto)
     |      
     |      Subsequently clicking and dragging a Turtle will move it
     |      across the screen thereby producing handdrawings (if pen is
     |      down).
     |  
     |  onrelease(self, fun, btn=1, add=None)
     |      Bind fun to mouse-button-release event on this turtle on canvas.
     |      
     |      Arguments:
     |      fun -- a function with two arguments, to which will be assigned
     |              the coordinates of the clicked point on the canvas.
     |      num --  number of the mouse-button defaults to 1 (left mouse button).
     |      
     |      Example (for a MyTurtle instance named joe):
     |      >>> class MyTurtle(Turtle):
     |      ...     def glow(self,x,y):
     |      ...             self.fillcolor("red")
     |      ...     def unglow(self,x,y):
     |      ...             self.fillcolor("")
     |      ...
     |      >>> joe = MyTurtle()
     |      >>> joe.onclick(joe.glow)
     |      >>> joe.onrelease(joe.unglow)
     |      
     |      Clicking on joe turns fillcolor red, unclicking turns it to
     |      transparent.
     |  
     |  reset(self)
     |      Delete the turtle's drawings and restore its default values.
     |      
     |              No argument.
     |      ,
     |              Delete the turtle's drawings from the screen, re-center the turtle
     |              and set variables to the default values.
     |      
     |              Example (for a Turtle instance named turtle):
     |              >>> turtle.position()
     |              (0.00,-22.00)
     |              >>> turtle.heading()
     |              100.0
     |              >>> turtle.reset()
     |              >>> turtle.position()
     |              (0.00,0.00)
     |              >>> turtle.heading()
     |              0.0
     |  
     |  settiltangle(self, angle)
     |      Rotate the turtleshape to point in the specified direction
     |      
     |      Optional argument:
     |      angle -- number
     |      
     |      Rotate the turtleshape to point in the direction specified by angle,
     |      regardless of its current tilt-angle. DO NOT change the turtle's
     |      heading (direction of movement).
     |      
     |      
     |      Examples (for a Turtle instance named turtle):
     |      >>> turtle.shape("circle")
     |      >>> turtle.shapesize(5,2)
     |      >>> turtle.settiltangle(45)
     |      >>> stamp()
     |      >>> turtle.fd(50)
     |      >>> turtle.settiltangle(-45)
     |      >>> stamp()
     |      >>> turtle.fd(50)
     |  
     |  setundobuffer(self, size)
     |      Set or disable undobuffer.
     |      
     |      Argument:
     |      size -- an integer or None
     |      
     |      If size is an integer an empty undobuffer of given size is installed.
     |      Size gives the maximum number of turtle-actions that can be undone
     |      by the undo() function.
     |      If size is None, no undobuffer is present.
     |      
     |      Example (for a Turtle instance named turtle):
     |      >>> turtle.setundobuffer(42)
     |  
     |  shape(self, name=None)
     |      Set turtle shape to shape with given name / return current shapename.
     |      
     |      Optional argument:
     |      name -- a string, which is a valid shapename
     |      
     |      Set turtle shape to shape with given name or, if name is not given,
     |      return name of current shape.
     |      Shape with name must exist in the TurtleScreen's shape dictionary.
     |      Initially there are the following polygon shapes:
     |      'arrow', 'turtle', 'circle', 'square', 'triangle', 'classic'.
     |      To learn about how to deal with shapes see Screen-method register_shape.
     |      
     |      Example (for a Turtle instance named turtle):
     |      >>> turtle.shape()
     |      'arrow'
     |      >>> turtle.shape("turtle")
     |      >>> turtle.shape()
     |      'turtle'
     |  
     |  shapesize(self, stretch_wid=None, stretch_len=None, outline=None)
     |      Set/return turtle's stretchfactors/outline. Set resizemode to "user".
     |      
     |      Optional arguments:
     |         stretch_wid : positive number
     |         stretch_len : positive number
     |         outline  : positive number
     |      
     |      Return or set the pen's attributes x/y-stretchfactors and/or outline.
     |      Set resizemode to "user".
     |      If and only if resizemode is set to "user", the turtle will be displayed
     |      stretched according to its stretchfactors:
     |      stretch_wid is stretchfactor perpendicular to orientation
     |      stretch_len is stretchfactor in direction of turtles orientation.
     |      outline determines the width of the shapes's outline.
     |      
     |      Examples (for a Turtle instance named turtle):
     |      >>> turtle.resizemode("user")
     |      >>> turtle.shapesize(5, 5, 12)
     |      >>> turtle.shapesize(outline=8)
     |  
     |  stamp(self)
     |      Stamp a copy of the turtleshape onto the canvas and return its id.
     |

     |      
     |      Stamp a copy of the turtle shape onto the canvas at the current
     |      turtle position. Return a stamp_id for that stamp, which can be
     |      used to delete it by calling clearstamp(stamp_id).
     |      
     |      Example (for a Turtle instance named turtle):
     |      >>> turtle.color("blue")
     |      >>> turtle.stamp()
     |      13
     |      >>> turtle.fd(50)
     |

     |      Rotate the turtleshape by angle.
     |      
     |      Argument:
     |      angle - a number
     |      
     |      Rotate the turtleshape by angle from its current tilt-angle,
     |      but do NOT change the turtle's heading (direction of movement).
     |      
     |      Examples (for a Turtle instance named turtle):
     |      >>> turtle.shape("circle")
     |      >>> turtle.shapesize(5,2)
     |      >>> turtle.tilt(30)

     |      
     |      Return the current tilt-angle, i. e. the angle between the
     |      orientation of the turtleshape and the heading of the turtle
     |      (its direction of movement).
     |      
     |      Examples (for a Turtle instance named turtle):
     |      >>> turtle.shape("circle")
     |      >>> turtle.shapesize(5,2)
     |      >>> turtle.tilt(45)
     |      >>> turtle.tiltangle()
     |  
     |  tracer(self, flag=None, delay=None)
     |      Turns turtle animation on/off and set delay for update drawings.
     |      
     |      Optional arguments:
     |      n -- nonnegative  integer
     |      delay -- nonnegative  integer
     |      
     |      If n is given, only each n-th regular screen update is really performed.
     |      (Can be used to accelerate the drawing of complex graphics.)
     |      Second arguments sets delay value (see RawTurtle.delay())
     |      
     |      Example (for a Turtle instance named turtle):
     |      >>> turtle.tracer(8, 25)
     |      >>> dist = 2
     |      >>> for i in range(200):
     |      ...     turtle.fd(dist)
     |      ...     turtle.rt(90)
     |      ...     dist += 2
     |  
     |  turtlesize = shapesize(self, stretch_wid=None, stretch_len=None, outline=None)
     |  
     |  undo(self)
     |      undo (repeatedly) the last turtle action.
     |      
     |      No argument.
     |      
     |      undo (repeatedly) the last turtle action.
     |      Number of available undo actions is determined by the size of
     |      the undobuffer.
     |      
     |      Example (for a Turtle instance named turtle):
     |      >>> for i in range(4):

     |  write(self, arg, move=False, align='left', font=('Arial', 8, 'normal'))
     |      Write text at the current turtle position.
     |      
     |      Arguments:

     |      It's a good idea to do this while you're in the
     |      middle of a complicated drawing, because hiding
     |      the turtle speeds up the drawing observably.

     |        - pencolor()
     |          Return the current pencolor as color specification string,
     |          possibly in hex-number format (see example).
     |          May be used as input to another color/pencolor/fillcolor call.
     |        - pencolor(colorstring)
     |          s is a Tk color specification string, such as "red" or "yellow"
     |        - pencolor((r, g, b))
     |          *a tuple* of r, g, and b, which represent, an RGB color,
     |          and each of r, g, and b are in the range 0..colormode,
     |          where colormode is either 1.0 or 255
     |        - pencolor(r, g, b)
     |          r, g, and b represent an RGB color, and each of r, g, and b
     |          are in the range 0..colormode
     |      
     |      If turtleshape is a polygon, the outline of that polygon is drawn

     |      
     |      Argument:
     |      width -- positive number
     |      
     |      Set the line thickness to width or return it. If resizemode is set
     |      to "auto" and turtleshape is a polygon, that polygon is drawn with
     |      the same line thickness. If no argument is given, current pensize
     |      is returned.

     |      Set resizemode to one of the values: "auto", "user", "noresize".
     |      
     |      (Optional) Argument:
     |      rmode -- one of the strings "auto", "user", "noresize"
     |      
     |      Different resizemodes have the following effects:
     |        - "auto" adapts the appearance of the turtle
     |                 corresponding to the value of pensize.
     |        - "user" adapts the appearance of the turtle according to the
     |                 values of stretchfactor and outlinewidth (outline),
     |                 which are set by shapesize()
     |        - "noresize" no adaption of the turtle's appearance takes place.
     |      If no argument is given, return current resizemode.
     |      resizemode("user") is called by a call of shapesize with arguments.
     |      
     |      
     |      Examples (for a Turtle instance named turtle):

     |  speed(self, speed=None)
     |      Return or set the turtle's speed.
     |      
     |      Optional argument:
     |      speed -- an integer in the range 0..10 or a speedstring (see below)
     |      
     |      Set the turtle's speed to an integer value in the range 0 .. 10.
     |      If no argument is given: return current speed.
     |      
     |      If input is a number greater than 10 or smaller than 0.5,
     |      speed is set to 0.
     |      Speedstrings  are mapped to speedvalues in the following way:
     |          'fastest' :  0
     |          'fast'    :  10
     |          'normal'  :  6
     |          'slow'    :  3
     |          'slowest' :  1
     |      speeds from 1 to 10 enforce increasingly faster animation of
     |      line drawing and turtle turning.
     |      
     |      Attention:
     |      speed = 0 : *no* animation takes place. forward/back makes turtle jump
     |      and likewise left/right make the turtle turn instantly.

     |      extent (optional) -- a number
     |      steps (optional) -- an integer
     |      
     |      Draw a circle with given radius. The center is radius units left
     |      of the turtle; extent - an angle - determines which part of the
     |      circle is drawn. If extent is not given, draw the entire circle.
     |      If extent is not a full circle, one endpoint of the arc is the
     |      current pen position. Draw the arc in counterclockwise direction

     |      the direction of the turtle is changed by the amount of extent.
     |      
     |      As the circle is approximated by an inscribed regular polygon,
     |      steps determines the number of steps to use. If not given,
     |      it will be calculated automatically. Maybe used to draw regular
     |      polygons.

     |  onclick(self, fun, btn=1, add=None)
     |      Bind fun to mouse-click event on this turtle on canvas.
     |      
     |      Arguments:

     |              the coordinates of the clicked point on the canvas.
     |      num --  number of the mouse-button defaults to 1 (left mouse button).
     |      add --  True or False. If True, new binding will be added, otherwise
     |              it will replace a former binding.
     |      
     |      Example for the anonymous turtle, i. e. the procedural way:
     |      
     |      >>> def turn(x, y):
     |      ...     left(360)
     |      ...
     |      >>> onclick(turn)  # Now clicking into the turtle will turn it.
     |      >>> onclick(None)  # event-binding will be removed
     |  
     |  ondrag(self, fun, btn=1, add=None)
     |      Bind fun to mouse-move event on this turtle on canvas.
     |      
     |      Arguments:
     |      fun -- a function with two arguments, to which will be assigned
     |             the coordinates of the clicked point on the canvas.
     |      num -- number of the mouse-button defaults to 1 (left mouse button).
     |      
     |      Every sequence of mouse-move-events on a turtle is preceded by a
     |      mouse-click event on that turtle.
     |      
     |      Example (for a Turtle instance named turtle):
     |      >>> turtle.ondrag(turtle.goto)
     |      
     |      Subsequently clicking and dragging a Turtle will move it
     |      across the screen thereby producing handdrawings (if pen is
     |      down).
     |  
     |  onrelease(self, fun, btn=1, add=None)
     |      Bind fun to mouse-button-release event on this turtle on canvas.
     |      
     |      Arguments:
     |      fun -- a function with two arguments, to which will be assigned
     |              the coordinates of the clicked point on the canvas.
     |      num --  number of the mouse-button defaults to 1 (left mouse button).
     |      
     |      Example (for a MyTurtle instance named joe):
     |      >>> class MyTurtle(Turtle):
     |      ...     def glow(self,x,y):
     |      ...             self.fillcolor("red")
     |      ...     def unglow(self,x,y):
     |      ...             self.fillcolor("")
     |      ...
     |      >>> joe = MyTurtle()
     |      >>> joe.onclick(joe.glow)
     |      >>> joe.onrelease(joe.unglow)
     |      
     |      Clicking on joe turns fillcolor red, unclicking turns it to
     |      transparent.
     |  
     |  reset(self)
     |      Delete the turtle's drawings and restore its default values.
     |      
     |              No argument.

     |              Delete the turtle's drawings from the screen, re-center the turtle
     |              and set variables to the default values.
     |      
     |              Example (for a Turtle instance named turtle):
     |              >>> turtle.position()
     |              (0.00,-22.00)
     |              >>> turtle.heading()
     |              100.0
     |              >>> turtle.reset()
     |              >>> turtle.position()
     |              (0.00,0.00)
     |              >>> turtle.heading()
     |              0.0
     |  
     |  settiltangle(self, angle)
     |      Rotate the turtleshape to point in the specified direction
     |      
     |      Optional argument:
     |      angle -- number
     |      
     |      Rotate the turtleshape to point in the direction specified by angle,
     |      regardless of its current tilt-angle. DO NOT change the turtle's
     |      heading (direction of movement).
     |      
     |      
     |      Examples (for a Turtle instance named turtle):
     |      >>> turtle.shape("circle")
     |      >>> turtle.shapesize(5,2)
     |      >>> turtle.settiltangle(45)
     |      >>> stamp()
     |      >>> turtle.fd(50)
     |      >>> turtle.settiltangle(-45)
     |      >>> stamp()
     |      >>> turtle.fd(50)
     |  
     |  setundobuffer(self, size)
     |      Set or disable undobuffer.
     |      
     |      Argument:
     |      size -- an integer or None
     |      
     |      If size is an integer an empty undobuffer of given size is installed.
     |      Size gives the maximum number of turtle-actions that can be undone
     |      by the undo() function.
     |      If size is None, no undobuffer is present.
     |

     |      >>> turtle.setundobuffer(42)
     |  
     |  shape(self, name=None)
     |      Set turtle shape to shape with given name / return current shapename.
     |      
     |      Optional argument:
     |      name -- a string, which is a valid shapename
     |      
     |      Set turtle shape to shape with given name or, if name is not given,
     |      return name of current shape.
     |      Shape with name must exist in the TurtleScreen's shape dictionary.
     |      Initially there are the following polygon shapes:
     |      'arrow', 'turtle', 'circle', 'square', 'triangle', 'classic'.
     |      To learn about how to deal with shapes see Screen-method register_shape.
     |      
     |      Example (for a Turtle instance named turtle):
     |      >>> turtle.shape()
     |      'arrow'
     |      >>> turtle.shape("turtle")
     |      >>> turtle.shape()
     |      'turtle'
     |  
     |  shapesize(self, stretch_wid=None, stretch_len=None, outline=None)
     |      Set/return turtle's stretchfactors/outline. Set resizemode to "user".
     |      
     |      Optional arguments:
     |         stretch_wid : positive number
     |         stretch_len : positive number
     |         outline  : positive number
     |      
     |      Return or set the pen's attributes x/y-stretchfactors and/or outline.
     |      Set resizemode to "user".
     |      If and only if resizemode is set to "user", the turtle will be displayed
     |      stretched according to its stretchfactors:
     |      stretch_wid is stretchfactor perpendicular to orientation
     |      stretch_len is stretchfactor in direction of turtles orientation.
     |      outline determines the width of the shapes's outline.
     |      
     |      Examples (for a Turtle instance named turtle):
     |      >>> turtle.resizemode("user")
     |      >>> turtle.shapesize(5, 5, 12)
     |      >>> turtle.shapesize(outline=8)
     |

     |      
     |      Stamp a copy of the turtle shape onto the canvas at the current
     |      turtle position. Return a stamp_id for that stamp, which can be
     |      used to delete it by calling clearstamp(stamp_id).
     |      
     |      Example (for a Turtle instance named turtle):
     |      >>> turtle.color("blue")
     |      >>> turtle.stamp()
     |      13
     |      >>> turtle.fd(50)

     |      
     |      Rotate the turtleshape by angle from its current tilt-angle,
     |      but do NOT change the turtle's heading (direction of movement).
     |      
     |      Examples (for a Turtle instance named turtle):
     |      >>> turtle.shape("circle")
     |      >>> turtle.shapesize(5,2)

     |      orientation of the turtleshape and the heading of the turtle
     |      (its direction of movement).
     |      
     |      Examples (for a Turtle instance named turtle):
     |      >>> turtle.shape("circle")

     |      stretched according to its stretchfactors:
     |      stretch_wid is stretchfactor perpendicular to orientation
     |      stretch_len is stretchfactor in direction of turtles orientation.
     |      outline determines the width of the shapes's outline.
     |      
     |      Examples (for a Turtle instance named turtle):

     |      undo (repeatedly) the last turtle action.
     |      
     |      No argument.
     |      
     |      undo (repeatedly) the last turtle action.
     |      Number of available undo actions is determined by the size of
     |      the undobuffer.
     |      
     |      Example (for a Turtle instance named turtle):
     |      >>> for i in range(4):

     |      640
     |  
     |  write(self, arg, move=False, align='left', font=('Arial', 8, 'normal'))
     |      Write text at the current turtle position.
     |

     |  Methods inherited from TPen:
     |  
     |  color(self, *args)
     |      Return or set the pencolor and fillcolor.
     |      
     |      Arguments:
     |      Several input formats are allowed.
     |      They use 0, 1, 2, or 3 arguments as follows:
     |      
     |      color()
     |          Return the current pencolor and the current fillcolor
     |          as a pair of color specification strings as are returned
     |          by pencolor and fillcolor.
     |      color(colorstring), color((r,g,b)), color(r,g,b)
     |          inputs as in pencolor, set both, fillcolor and pencolor,
     |          to the given value.
     |      color(colorstring1, colorstring2),
     |      color((r1,g1,b1), (r2,g2,b2))
     |          equivalent to pencolor(colorstring1) and fillcolor(colorstring2)
     |          and analogously, if the other input format is used.
     |      
     |      If turtleshape is a polygon, outline and interior of that polygon
     |      is drawn with the newly set colors.
     |      For mor info see: pencolor, fillcolor
     |      
     |      Example (for a Turtle instance named turtle):
     |      >>> turtle.color('red', 'green')
     |      >>> turtle.color()
     |      ('red', 'green')
     |      >>> colormode(255)
     |      >>> color((40, 80, 120), (160, 200, 240))
     |      >>> color()
     |      ('#285078', '#a0c8f0')
     |  
     |  down = pendown(self)
     |      Pull the pen down -- drawing when moving.
     |      
     |      Aliases: pendown | pd | down
     |      
     |      No argument.
     |      
     |      Example (for a Turtle instance named turtle):
     |      >>> turtle.pendown()
     |  
     |  fillcolor(self, *args)
     |      Return or set the fillcolor.
     |      
     |      Arguments:
     |      Four input formats are allowed:
     |        - fillcolor()
     |          Return the current fillcolor as color specification string,
     |          possibly in hex-number format (see example).
     |          May be used as input to another color/pencolor/fillcolor call.
     |        - fillcolor(colorstring)
     |          s is a Tk color specification string, such as "red" or "yellow"
     |        - fillcolor((r, g, b))
     |          *a tuple* of r, g, and b, which represent, an RGB color,
     |          and each of r, g, and b are in the range 0..colormode,
     |          where colormode is either 1.0 or 255
     |        - fillcolor(r, g, b)
     |          r, g, and b represent an RGB color, and each of r, g, and b
     |          are in the range 0..colormode
     |      
     |      If turtleshape is a polygon, the interior of that polygon is drawn
     |      with the newly set fillcolor.
     |      
     |      Example (for a Turtle instance named turtle):
     |      >>> turtle.fillcolor('violet')
     |      >>> col = turtle.pencolor()
     |      >>> turtle.fillcolor(col)
     |      >>> turtle.fillcolor(0, .5, 0)
     |  
     |  hideturtle(self)
     |      Makes the turtle invisible.
     |      
     |      Aliases: hideturtle | ht
     |      
     |      No argument.
     |      
     |      It's a good idea to do this while you're in the
     |      middle of a complicated drawing, because hiding
     |      the turtle speeds up the drawing observably.
     |      
     |      Example (for a Turtle instance named turtle):
     |      >>> turtle.hideturtle()
     |  
     |  ht = hideturtle(self)

     |      Return or set the pen's attributes.
     |      
     |      Arguments:
     |          pen -- a dictionary with some or all of the below listed keys.
     |          **pendict -- one or more keyword-arguments with the below
     |                       listed keys as keywords.
     |      
     |      Return or set the pen's attributes in a 'pen-dictionary'
     |      with the following key/value pairs:
     |         "shown"      :   True/False

     |         "tilt"       :   number
     |      
     |      This dictionary can be used as argument for a subsequent
     |      pen()-call to restore the former pen-state. Moreover one
     |      or more of these attributes can be provided as keyword-arguments.
     |      This can be used to set several pen attributes in one statement.
     |      
     |      
     |      Examples (for a Turtle instance named turtle):

     |      Argument:
     |      width -- positive number
     |      
     |      Set the line thickness to width or return it. If resizemode is set
     |      to "auto" and turtleshape is a polygon, that polygon is drawn with
     |      the same line thickness. If no argument is given, current pensize

     |      Set resizemode to one of the values: "auto", "user", "noresize".
     |      
     |      (Optional) Argument:
     |      rmode -- one of the strings "auto", "user", "noresize"
     |      
     |      Different resizemodes have the following effects:
     |        - "auto" adapts the appearance of the turtle
     |                 corresponding to the value of pensize.
     |        - "user" adapts the appearance of the turtle according to the
     |                 values of stretchfactor and outlinewidth (outline),
     |                 which are set by shapesize()
     |        - "noresize" no adaption of the turtle's appearance takes place.
     |      If no argument is given, return current resizemode.
     |      resizemode("user") is called by a call of shapesize with arguments.
     |

     |      
     |      Optional argument:
     |      speed -- an integer in the range 0..10 or a speedstring (see below)
     |      
     |      Set the turtle's speed to an integer value in the range 0 .. 10.
     |      If no argument is given: return current speed.
     |      
     |      If input is a number greater than 10 or smaller than 0.5,
     |      speed is set to 0.
     |      Speedstrings  are mapped to speedvalues in the following way:
     |          'fastest' :  0
     |          'fast'    :  10
     |          'normal'  :  6
     |          'slow'    :  3
     |          'slowest' :  1
     |      speeds from 1 to 10 enforce increasingly faster animation of
     |      line drawing and turtle turning.
     |      
     |      Attention:
     |      speed = 0 : *no* animation takes place. forward/back makes turtle jump
     |      and likewise left/right make the turtle turn instantly.

     |      
     |      Draw a circle with given radius. The center is radius units left

     |             clicked point on the canvas.
     |      num -- the number of the mouse-button, defaults to 1
     |      
     |      Example (for a TurtleScreen instance named screen
     |      and a Turtle instance named turtle):
     |      
     |      >>> screen.onclick(goto)
     |      >>> # Subsequently clicking into the TurtleScreen will
     |      >>> # make the turtle move to the clicked point.
     |      >>> screen.onclick(None)
     |  
     |  onkey(self, fun, key)
     |      Bind fun to key-release event of key.

     |      key -- a string: key (e.g. "a") or key-symbol (e.g. "space")
     |      
     |      In order to be able to register key-events, TurtleScreen
     |      must have focus. (See method listen.)
     |      
     |      Example (for a TurtleScreen instance named screen):

     |      >>> screen.listen()
     |      
     |      Subsequently the turtle can be moved by repeatedly pressing
     |      the up-arrow key, consequently drawing a hexagon
     |

     |  register_shape(self, name, shape=None)
     |      Adds a turtle shape to TurtleScreen's shapelist.
     |      
     |      Arguments:
     |      (1) name is the name of a gif-file and shape is None.
     |          Installs the corresponding image shape.
     |          !! Image-shapes DO NOT rotate when turning the turtle,
     |          !! so they do not display the heading of the turtle!
     |      (2) name is an arbitrary string and shape is a tuple
     |          of pairs of coordinates. Installs the corresponding
     |          polygon shape
     |      (3) name is an arbitrary string and shape is a
     |          (compound) Shape object. Installs the corresponding
     |          compound shape.
     |      To use a shape, you have to issue the command shape(shapename).
     |      
     |      call: register_shape("turtle.gif")
     |      --or: register_shape("tri", ((0,0), (10,10), (-10,10)))
     |      
     |      Example (for a TurtleScreen instance named screen):
     |      >>> screen.register_shape("triangle", ((5,-3),(0,5),(-5,-3)))
     |  
     |  reset(self)
     |      Reset all Turtles on the Screen to their initial state.
     |      
     |      No argument.
     |      
     |      Example (for a TurtleScreen instance named screen):
     |      >>> screen.reset()
     |  
     |  resetscreen = reset(self)
     |  
     |  screensize(self, canvwidth=None, canvheight=None, bg=None)
     |      Resize the canvas the turtles are drawing on.
     |      
     |      Optional arguments:
     |      canvwidth -- positive integer, new width of canvas in pixels
     |      canvheight --  positive integer, new height of canvas in pixels
     |      bg -- colorstring or color-tuple, new backgroundcolor
     |      If no arguments are given, return current (canvaswidth, canvasheight)
     |      
     |      Do not alter the drawing window. To observe hidden parts of
     |      the canvas use the scrollbars. (Can make visible those parts
     |      of a drawing, which were outside the canvas before!)
     |      
     |      Example (for a Turtle instance named turtle):
     |      >>> turtle.screensize(2000,1500)
     |      >>> # e. g. to search for an erroneously escaped turtle ;-)
     |  
     |  setworldcoordinates(self, llx, lly, urx, ury)
     |      Set up a user defined coordinate-system.
     |      
     |      Arguments:

     |      lly -- a number, y-coordinate of lower left corner of canvas
     |      urx -- a number, x-coordinate of upper right corner of canvas
     |      ury -- a number, y-coordinate of upper right corner of canvas
     |      
     |      Set up user coodinat-system and switch to mode 'world' if necessary.
     |      This performs a screen.reset. If mode 'world' is already active,
     |      all drawings are redrawn according to the new coordinates.
     |      
     |      But ATTENTION: in user-defined coordinatesystems angles may appear
     |      distorted. (see Screen.mode())
     |      
     |      Example (for a TurtleScreen instance named screen):
     |      >>> screen.setworldcoordinates(-10,-0.5,50,1.5)
     |      >>> for _ in range(36):
     |      ...     left(10)
     |      ...     forward(0.5)
     |  
     |  tracer(self, n=None, delay=None)
     |      Turns turtle animation on/off and set delay for update drawings.
     |      
     |      Optional arguments:
     |      n -- nonnegative  integer
     |      delay -- nonnegative  integer
     |      
     |      If n is given, only each n-th regular screen update is really performed.
     |      (Can be used to accelerate the drawing of complex graphics.)
     |      Second arguments sets delay value (see RawTurtle.delay())
     |      
     |      Example (for a TurtleScreen instance named screen):
     |      >>> screen.tracer(8, 25)
     |      >>> dist = 2
     |      >>> for i in range(200):
     |      ...     fd(dist)
     |      ...     rt(90)
     |      ...     dist += 2

     |      480
     |  
     |  window_width(self)
     |      Return the width of the turtle window.
     |

        extent (optional) -- a number
        steps (optional) -- an integer
        
        Draw a circle with given radius. The center is radius units left
        of the turtle; extent - an angle - determines which part of the
        circle is drawn. If extent is not given, draw the entire circle.
        If extent is not a full circle, one endpoint of the arc is the
        current pen position. Draw the arc in counterclockwise direction
        if radius is positive, otherwise in clockwise direction. Finally
        the direction of the turtle is changed by the amount of extent.
        
        As the circle is approximated by an inscribed regular polygon,
        steps determines the number of steps to use. If not given,
        it will be calculated automatically. Maybe used to draw regular
        polygons.
        
        call: circle(radius)                  # full circle
        --or: circle(radius, extent)          # arc
        --or: circle(radius, extent, steps)
        --or: circle(radius, steps=6)         # 6-sided polygon
        
        Example:
        >>> circle(50)
        >>> circle(120, 180)  # semicircle

        >>> fd(50)
        >>> clearstamp(astamp)
    
    clearstamps(n=None)
        Delete all or first/last n of turtle's stamps.
        
        Optional argument:

        If n is None, delete all of pen's stamps,
        else if n > 0 delete first n stamps
        else if n < 0 delete last n stamps.
        
        Example:
        >>> for i in range(8):
        ...     stamp(); fd(30)
        ...

        They use 0, 1, 2, or 3 arguments as follows:
        
        color()
            Return the current pencolor and the current fillcolor
            as a pair of color specification strings as are returned
            by pencolor and fillcolor.
        color(colorstring), color((r,g,b)), color(r,g,b)
            inputs as in pencolor, set both, fillcolor and pencolor,
            to the given value.
        color(colorstring1, colorstring2),
        color((r1,g1,b1), (r2,g2,b2))
            equivalent to pencolor(colorstring1) and fillcolor(colorstring2)

        No argument.
        
        Only reasonable use: as a function to return the 'anonymous turtle':
        
        Example:
        >>> pet = getturtle()
        >>> pet.fd(50)
        >>> pet

        >>> onclick(turn)  # Now clicking into the turtle will turn it.
        >>> onclick(None)  # event-binding will be removed
    
    ondrag(fun, btn=1, add=None)
        Bind fun to mouse-move event on this turtle on canvas.
        
        Arguments:
        fun -- a function with two arguments, to which will be assigned
               the coordinates of the clicked point on the canvas.
        num -- number of the mouse-button defaults to 1 (left mouse button).
        
        Every sequence of mouse-move-events on a turtle is preceded by a
        mouse-click event on that 
        
        Example:
        >>> ondrag(goto)
        
        Subsequently clicking and dragging a Turtle will move it
        across the screen thereby producing handdrawings (if pen is
        down).
    
    onkey(fun, key)
        Bind fun to key-release event of key.
        
        Arguments:
        fun -- a function with no arguments
        key -- a string: key (e.g. "a") or key-symbol (e.g. "space")
        
        In order to be able to register key-events, TurtleScreen
        must have focus. (See method listen.)
        
        Example:
        
        >>> def f():
        ...     fd(50)
        ...     lt(60)
        ...
        >>> onkey(f, "Up")
        >>> listen()
        
        Subsequently the turtle can be moved by repeatedly pressing
        the up-arrow key, consequently drawing a hexagon
    
    onrelease(fun, btn=1, add=None)
        Bind fun to mouse-button-release event on this turtle on canvas.
        
        Arguments:
        fun -- a function with two arguments, to which will be assigned
                the coordinates of the clicked point on the canvas.
        num --  number of the mouse-button defaults to 1 (left mouse button).
        
        Example (for a MyTurtle instance named joe):
        >>> class MyTurtle(Turtle):
        ...     def glow(self,x,y):
        ...             self.fillcolor("red")
        ...     def unglow(self,x,y):
        ...             self.fillcolor("")
        ...
        >>> joe = MyTurtle()
        >>> joe.onclick(joe.glow)
        >>> joe.onrelease(joe.unglow)
        
        Clicking on joe turns fillcolor red, unclicking turns it to
        transparent.
    
    onscreenclick(fun, btn=1, add=None)
        Bind fun to mouse-click event on canvas.
        
        Arguments:
        fun -- a function with two arguments, the coordinates of the
               clicked point on the canvas.
        num -- the number of the mouse-button, defaults to 1
        
        Example (for a TurtleScreen instance named screen
        and a Turtle instance named turtle):
        
        >>> onclick(goto)
        >>> # Subsequently clicking into the TurtleScreen will
        >>> # make the turtle move to the clicked point.
        >>> onclick(None)
    
    ontimer(fun, t=0)
        Install a timer, which calls fun after t milliseconds.
        
        Arguments:
        fun -- a function with no arguments.
        t -- a number >= 0
        
        Example:
        
        >>> running = True
        >>> def f():
        ...     if running:
        ...             fd(50)
        ...             lt(60)
        ...             ontimer(f, 250)
        ...
        >>> f()   # makes the turtle marching around
        >>> running = False
    
    pd()
        Pull the pen down -- drawing when moving.
        
        Aliases: pendown | pd | down
        
        No argument.
        
        Example:
        >>> pendown()
    
    pen(pen=None, **pendict)
        Return or set the pen's attributes.
        
        Arguments:
            pen -- a dictionary with some or all of the below listed keys.
            **pendict -- one or more keyword-arguments with the below
                         listed keys as keywords.
        
        Return or set the pen's attributes in a 'pen-dictionary'
        with the following key/value pairs:
           "shown"      :   True/False
           "pendown"    :   True/False
           "pencolor"   :   color-string or color-tuple
           "fillcolor"  :   color-string or color-tuple
           "pensize"    :   positive number
           "speed"      :   number in range 0..10
           "resizemode" :   "auto" or "user" or "noresize"
           "stretchfactor": (positive number, positive number)
           "outline"    :   positive number
           "tilt"       :   number
        
        This dictionary can be used as argument for a subsequent
        pen()-call to restore the former pen-state. Moreover one
        or more of these attributes can be provided as keyword-arguments.
        This can be used to set several pen attributes in one statement.
        
        
        Examples:
        >>> pen(fillcolor="black", pencolor="red", pensize=10)
        >>> pen()
        {'pensize': 10, 'shown': True, 'resizemode': 'auto', 'outline': 1,
        'pencolor': 'red', 'pendown': True, 'fillcolor': 'black',
        'stretchfactor': (1,1), 'speed': 3}
        >>> penstate=pen()
        >>> color("yellow","")
        >>> penup()
        >>> pen()
        {'pensize': 10, 'shown': True, 'resizemode': 'auto', 'outline': 1,
        'pencolor': 'yellow', 'pendown': False, 'fillcolor': '',
        'stretchfactor': (1,1), 'speed': 3}
        >>> p.pen(penstate, fillcolor="green")
        >>> p.pen()
        {'pensize': 10, 'shown': True, 'resizemode': 'auto', 'outline': 1,
        'pencolor': 'red', 'pendown': True, 'fillcolor': 'green',
        'stretchfactor': (1,1), 'speed': 3}
    
    pencolor(*args)
        Return or set the pencolor.
        
        Arguments:
        Four input formats are allowed:
          - pencolor()
            Return the current pencolor as color specification string,
            possibly in hex-number format (see example).
            May be used as input to another color/pencolor/fillcolor call.
          - pencolor(colorstring)
            s is a Tk color specification string, such as "red" or "yellow"
          - pencolor((r, g, b))

            r, g, and b represent an RGB color, and each of r, g, and b
            are in the range 0..colormode
        
        If turtleshape is a polygon, the outline of that polygon is drawn
        with the newly set pencolor.
        
        Example:
        >>> pencolor('brown')
        >>> tup = (0.2, 0.8, 0.55)
        >>> pencolor(tup)
        >>> pencolor()
        '#33cc8c'
    
    pendown()

        Argument:
        width -- positive number
        
        Set the line thickness to width or return it. If resizemode is set
        to "auto" and turtleshape is a polygon, that polygon is drawn with
        the same line thickness. If no argument is given, current pensize
        is returned.
        
        Example:
        >>> pensize()
        1
        >>> pensize(10)   # from here on lines of width 10 are drawn
    
    penup()
        Pull the pen up -- no drawing when moving.
        
        Aliases: penup | pu | up

    register_shape(name, shape=None)
        Adds a turtle shape to TurtleScreen's shapelist.
        
        Arguments:
        (1) name is the name of a gif-file and shape is None.
            Installs the corresponding image shape.
            !! Image-shapes DO NOT rotate when turning the turtle,
            !! so they do not display the heading of the turtle!
        (2) name is an arbitrary string and shape is a tuple
            of pairs of coordinates. Installs the corresponding
            polygon shape
        (3) name is an arbitrary string and shape is a
            (compound) Shape object. Installs the corresponding
            compound shape.
        To use a shape, you have to issue the command shape(shapename).
        
        call: register_shape("turtle.gif")
        --or: register_shape("tri", ((0,0), (10,10), (-10,10)))
        
        Example:
        >>> register_shape("triangle", ((5,-3),(0,5),(-5,-3)))
    
    reset()
        Delete the turtle's drawings and restore its default values.
        
                No argument.
        ,
                Delete the turtle's drawings from the screen, re-center the turtle
                and set variables to the default values.
        
                Example:
                >>> position()
                (0.00,-22.00)
                >>> heading()
                100.0
                >>> reset()
                >>> position()
                (0.00,0.00)

        Example:
        >>> reset()
    
    resizemode(rmode=None)
        Set resizemode to one of the values: "auto", "user", "noresize".
        
        (Optional) Argument:
        rmode -- one of the strings "auto", "user", "noresize"
        
        Different resizemodes have the following effects:
          - "auto" adapts the appearance of the turtle
                   corresponding to the value of pensize.
          - "user" adapts the appearance of the turtle according to the
                   values of stretchfactor and outlinewidth (outline),
                   which are set by shapesize()
          - "noresize" no adaption of the turtle's appearance takes place.
        If no argument is given, return current resizemode.
        resizemode("user") is called by a call of shapesize with arguments.
        
        
        Examples:
        >>> resizemode("noresize")
        >>> resizemode()
        'noresize'
    
    right(angle)
        Turn turtle right by angle units.

        Argument:
        angle -- a number (integer or float)
        
        Turn turtle right by angle units. (Units are by default degrees,
        but can be set via the degrees() and radians() functions.)
        Angle orientation depends on mode. (See this.)
        
        Example:
        >>> heading()
        22.0
        >>> right(45)
        >>> heading()
        337.0
    
    rt(angle)
        Turn turtle right by angle units.
        
        Aliases: right | rt
        
        Argument:
        angle -- a number (integer or float)
        
        Turn turtle right by angle units. (Units are by default degrees,
        but can be set via the degrees() and radians() functions.)
        Angle orientation depends on mode. (See this.)
        
        Example:
        >>> heading()
        22.0
        >>> right(45)
        >>> heading()
        337.0
    
    screensize(canvwidth=None, canvheight=None, bg=None)
        Resize the canvas the turtles are drawing on.
        
        Optional arguments:
        canvwidth -- positive integer, new width of canvas in pixels
        canvheight --  positive integer, new height of canvas in pixels
        bg -- colorstring or color-tuple, new backgroundcolor
        If no arguments are given, return current (canvaswidth, canvasheight)
        
        Do not alter the drawing window. To observe hidden parts of
        the canvas use the scrollbars. (Can make visible those parts
        of a drawing, which were outside the canvas before!)
        
        Example (for a Turtle instance named turtle):
        >>> turtle.screensize(2000,1500)
        >>> # e. g. to search for an erroneously escaped turtle ;-)
    
    seth(to_angle)
        Set the orientation of the turtle to to_angle.
        
        Aliases:  setheading | seth
        
        Argument:
        to_angle -- a number (integer or float)
        
        Set the orientation of the turtle to to_angle.
        Here are some common directions in degrees:

        >>> setpos(tp)
        >>> pos()
        (0.00,0.00)
    
    settiltangle(angle)
        Rotate the turtleshape to point in the specified direction
        
        Optional argument:
        angle -- number
        
        Rotate the turtleshape to point in the direction specified by angle,
        regardless of its current tilt-angle. DO NOT change the turtle's
        heading (direction of movement).
        
        
        Examples:
        >>> shape("circle")
        >>> shapesize(5,2)
        >>> settiltangle(45)
        >>> stamp()
        >>> fd(50)
        >>> settiltangle(-45)
        >>> stamp()
        >>> fd(50)
    
    setundobuffer(size)
        Set or disable undobuffer.
        
        Argument:
        size -- an integer or None
        
        If size is an integer an empty undobuffer of given size is installed.
        Size gives the maximum number of turtle-actions that can be undone
        by the undo() function.
        If size is None, no undobuffer is present.
        
        Example:
        >>> setundobuffer(42)
    
    setup(width=0.5, height=0.75, startx=None, starty=None)
        Set the size and position of the main window.
        
        Arguments:
        width: as integer a size in pixels, as float a fraction of the 
          Default is 50% of 
        height: as integer the height in pixels, as float a fraction of the
           Default is 75% of 
        startx: if positive, starting position in pixels from the left
          edge of the screen, if negative from the right edge
          Default, startx=None is to center window horizontally.
        starty: if positive, starting position in pixels from the top
          edge of the screen, if negative from the bottom edge
          Default, starty=None is to center window vertically.
        
        Examples:
        >>> setup (width=200, height=200, startx=0, starty=0)
        
        sets window to 200x200 pixels, in upper left of screen
        
        >>> setup(width=.75, height=0.5, startx=None, starty=None)
        
        sets window to 75% of screen by 50% of screen and centers
    
    setworldcoordinates(llx, lly, urx, ury)
        Set up a user defined coordinate-system.
        
        Arguments:
        llx -- a number, x-coordinate of lower left corner of canvas
        lly -- a number, y-coordinate of lower left corner of canvas
        urx -- a number, x-coordinate of upper right corner of canvas
        ury -- a number, y-coordinate of upper right corner of canvas
        
        Set up user coodinat-system and switch to mode 'world' if necessary.
        This performs a reset. If mode 'world' is already active,
        all drawings are redrawn according to the new coordinates.
        
        But ATTENTION: in user-defined coordinatesystems angles may appear
        distorted. (see Screen.mode())
        
        Example:
        >>> setworldcoordinates(-10,-0.5,50,1.5)
        >>> for _ in range(36):
        ...     left(10)
        ...     forward(0.5)
    
    setx(x)
        Set the turtle's first coordinate to x
        
        Argument:
        x -- a number (integer or float)
        
        Set the turtle's first coordinate to x, leave second coordinate
        unchanged.
        
        Example:
        >>> position()
        (0.00, 240.00)
        >>> setx(10)
        >>> position()
        (10.00, 240.00)
    
    sety(y)
        Set the turtle's second coordinate to y
        
        Argument:
        y -- a number (integer or float)
        
        Set the turtle's first coordinate to x, second coordinate remains
        unchanged.
        
        Example:
        >>> position()
        (0.00, 40.00)
        >>> sety(-10)
        >>> position()
        (0.00, -10.00)
    
    shape(name=None)
        Set turtle shape to shape with given name / return current shapename.
        
        Optional argument:
        name -- a string, which is a valid shapename
        
        Set turtle shape to shape with given name or, if name is not given,
        return name of current shape.
        Shape with name must exist in the TurtleScreen's shape dictionary.
        Initially there are the following polygon shapes:
        'arrow', 'turtle', 'circle', 'square', 'triangle', 'classic'.
        To learn about how to deal with shapes see Screen-method register_shape.
        
        Example:
        >>> shape()
        'arrow'
        >>> shape("turtle")
        >>> shape()
        'turtle'
    
    shapesize(stretch_wid=None, stretch_len=None, outline=None)
        Set/return turtle's stretchfactors/outline. Set resizemode to "user".
        
        Optional arguments:
           stretch_wid : positive number
           stretch_len : positive number
           outline  : positive number
        
        Return or set the pen's attributes x/y-stretchfactors and/or outline.
        Set resizemode to "user".
        If and only if resizemode is set to "user", the turtle will be displayed
        stretched according to its stretchfactors:
        stretch_wid is stretchfactor perpendicular to orientation
        stretch_len is stretchfactor in direction of turtles orientation.
        outline determines the width of the shapes's outline.
        
        Examples:
        >>> resizemode("user")
        >>> shapesize(5, 5, 12)
        >>> shapesize(outline=8)
    
    showturtle()
        Makes the turtle visible.
        
        Aliases: showturtle | st
        
        No argument.
        
        Example:
        >>> hideturtle()
        >>> showturtle()
    
    sin(...)
        sin(x)
        
        Return the sine of x (measured in radians).
    
    sinh(...)
        sinh(x)
        
        Return the hyperbolic sine of x.
    
    speed(speed=None)
        Return or set the turtle's speed.
        
        Optional argument:
        speed -- an integer in the range 0..10 or a speedstring (see below)
        
        Set the turtle's speed to an integer value in the range 0 .. 10.
        If no argument is given: return current speed.
        
        If input is a number greater than 10 or smaller than 0.5,
        speed is set to 0.
        Speedstrings  are mapped to speedvalues in the following way:
            'fastest' :  0
            'fast'    :  10
            'normal'  :  6
            'slow'    :  3
            'slowest' :  1
        speeds from 1 to 10 enforce increasingly faster animation of
        line drawing and turtle turning.
        
        Attention:
        speed = 0 : *no* animation takes place. forward/back makes turtle jump
        and likewise left/right make the turtle turn instantly.
        
        Example:
        >>> speed(3)
    
    sqrt(...)
        sqrt(x)
        
        Return the square root of x.

        No argument.
        
        Stamp a copy of the turtle shape onto the canvas at the current
        turtle position. Return a stamp_id for that stamp, which can be
        used to delete it by calling clearstamp(stamp_id).
        
        Example:
        >>> color("blue")
        >>> stamp()
        13
        >>> fd(50)
    
    tan(...)
        tan(x)
        
        Return the tangent of x (measured in radians).

        Return the hyperbolic tangent of x.
    
    tilt(angle)

        No argument.
        
        Return the current tilt-angle, i. e. the angle between the
        orientation of the turtleshape and the heading of the turtle
        (its direction of movement).
        
        Examples:
        >>> shape("circle")
        >>> shapesize(5,2)
        >>> tilt(45)
        >>> tiltangle()
    
    title(titlestring)
        Set title of turtle-window

        y -- a number       None                            None
        
        call: distance(x, y)         # two coordinates
        --or: distance((x, y))       # a pair (tuple) of coordinates
        --or: distance(vec)          # e.g. as returned by pos()
        --or: distance(mypen)        # where mypen is another turtle
        
        Return the angle, between the line from turtle-position to position

        (Can be used to accelerate the drawing of complex graphics.)
        Second arguments sets delay value (see RawTurtle.delay())
        
        Example:
        >>> tracer(8, 25)
        >>> dist = 2
        >>> for i in range(200):
        ...     fd(dist)
        ...     rt(90)
        ...     dist += 2

        turtle position according to align ("left", "center" or right")
        and with the given font.
        If move is True, the pen is moved to the bottom-right corner
        of the text. By default, move is False.
